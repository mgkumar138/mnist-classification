# mnist-classification
Simple neural networks to understand building neural nets and testing 

Created 3 versions of deep learning architectures 
1) basic neural net with 1 hidden layer 
2) basic convolutional neural net 
3) CNN with several layers. 

Use keras main to load MNIST and call neural_networks to run the choosen nets
